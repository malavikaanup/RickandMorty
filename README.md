# RickandMorty

- Implemented RickAndMorty REST API
- MVVM Architecture
- RxSwift for API integration
- Codable Data Models
- The app contains 2 screens
- Screen 1 : List of all episodes with pagination
- Select any episode > Screen 2
- Screen 2 : The list of characters in the selected episode.

FYI: I had the plan to implement a search in episode where we could make use of the filter API but due to time constraints, I could complete only the above mentioned.
